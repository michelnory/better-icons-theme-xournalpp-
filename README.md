Making Xournal++ look better on windows.

I didn't change all of the 64 icons, I only change the ones on my toolbar setting and a few more.

Most of the icons I got from [Material Symbols & Icons - Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols), although a few of them I made myself tweaking the original ones.
- The page color I use is `#191919`
## Toolbar with custom colors (optional)
Xournal++ default colors are to bright for my taste That's why I changed them 
To use my custom toolbar:
1. Download the `toolbar.ini` file. 
2. Got to `C:\Programs\Xournal++\share\xournalpp`.
3. Paste the file.

Now you only have to open xournal++, go to `view>Toolbars>Mietzsche'.
## Theme
First we change the toolbars background color:
1. Download the `xournalpp.css` file
2. Got to `C:\Program Files\Xournal++\share\xournalpp`.
3. Paste the file.

Then we change the background color:
1. Go to `Edit>Preferences` 
2. Go to `view`
3. Change the border color to `#1a5fb4`
4. Change the background color to `#353537`
